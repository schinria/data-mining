# data-mining

I used R and exploratory analysis and data mining techniques (including logistic regression, single-tree, bagging, random forests, boosting, and BART) to create models that predict prices of rental listings (by quartile) using the Inside Airbnb dataset, which was scraped and compiled by Murray Cox, from Airbnb's website listings for San Francisco in May 2015.
